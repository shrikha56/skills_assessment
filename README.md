# INFO1111 Group Project – T3-ET-Group-5

This repository contains our collaborative submission for the INFO1111 Term 3 2025 group project at the University of Sydney. The project focused on the application of technical and professional skills in Git, LaTeX, and domain-specific computing knowledge to address a real-world disaster response scenario.

---

## Project Overview: Disaster Response Communication System

Our team developed a conceptual solution to enhance communication and optimise resource allocation during crisis events such as the 2025 LA wildfires. Each group member was assigned a computing discipline and contributed specialised knowledge:

- **Computer Science** – System architecture and WebSocket-based integration
- **Data Science** – Predictive modelling and data analysis using Pandas
- **Software Development** – Modular system design and offline-first functionality
- **Cyber Security** – Information assurance and mitigation of misinformation

## Task 1: Foundational Skills and Collaboration

### Project Management

- GitHub repository and project board established to track task progress
- Team members assigned and resolved GitHub issues
- Local repositories cloned and compiled using the command line
- Commits and pushes executed via Git CLI
- Tutor added to the repository for visibility and review

### Collaborative Reflection

- Initial conflicting perspectives were resolved using the SMART goal framework
- The final system design balanced performance, cost, usability, and security
- Team members demonstrated a shift from individual problem-solving to collective decision-making

### Individual Reflections

Each team member addressed:

- Relevant technical and professional skills (as aligned with the SFIA framework)
- Skill development achieved through collaboration
- Areas for future improvement (e.g., system optimisation, test-driven development, communication across disciplines)

Individual responses are documented in the LaTeX file (`main.tex`) under designated sections.

## Task 2: Advanced Skills and Technical Exploration

### Component 1: GitHub Project Management

- Issues were created and tracked using a GitHub project board
- Tasks were filtered by labels and status (e.g., "in progress", "done")
- A line chart was generated to illustrate project activity over time

### Component 2: Exploration of Tools by Discipline

Each student researched and applied a tool relevant to their assigned major:

| Name               | Discipline          | Tool         | Application Context |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Apurva Lohia       | Computer Science    | WebSockets   | Real-time system integration and offline data sync |
| Shrikha Pentakota  | Data Science        | Pandas       | Fire severity data analysis and visualisation |
| Poorvi Banwala     | Software Development| Pytest       | Code testing for offline-first system components |
| Nila Fernando      | Cyber Security      | Burp Suite   | Inspection of communication security and traffic interception |

Each report included:
- Overview of three key functionalities of the tool
- Its relevance to the given scenario and broader industry application
- At least three limitations
- A practical implementation example
- A reflective discussion of the learning process and challenges encountered

---

## Technical Evidence

- Compilation of LaTeX document via command line
- Evidence of local Git commits and pushes
- Inclusion of data visualisations, code snippets, and filtered project activity views

---

## Referencing and Citation

- All in-text citations follow the IEEE referencing style
- A properly formatted reference list is included in the `.bib` file
- Citations are consistent, relevant, and aligned with academic integrity standards

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the team’s capability to collaborate across disciplines, apply technical skills to a real-world scenario, and reflect on individual and collective growth. Through structured version control, domain-specific tool exploration, and consistent communication, the team achieved a solution that balances technical feasibility with practical constraints. The repository provides evidence of both foundational and advanced competencies as defined in the INFO1111 assessment criteria.
